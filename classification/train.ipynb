As such, **if your data contains data types and values that are not numbers, such as labels, you will need to change the data into numbers**. Further, specific machine learning algorithms have expectations regarding the data types, scale, probability distribution, and relationships between input variables, and you may need to change the data to meet these expectations.\n","\n","The philosophy of **data preparation** is to discover how to best expose the unknown underlying structure of the problem to the learning algorithms. This often requires **an iterative path of experimentation through a suite of different data preparation techniques** in order to discover what works well or best. The vast majority of the machine learning algorithms you may use on a project are years to decades old. **The implementation and application of the algorithms are well understood**. So much so that they are routine, with amazing, fully-featured open-source machine learning libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in Python. \n","```\n","The thing that is different from project to project is the data. \n","```\n","\n","You may be the first person (ever!) to use a specific dataset as the basis for a predictive modeling project.
