As such, **if your data contains data types and values that are not numbers, such as labels, you will need to change the data into numbers**. Further, specific machine learning algorithms have expectations regarding the data types, scale, probability distribution, and relationships between input variables, and you may need to change the data to meet these expectations.\n","\n","The philosophy of **data preparation** is to discover how to best expose the unknown underlying structure of the problem to the learning algorithms.
